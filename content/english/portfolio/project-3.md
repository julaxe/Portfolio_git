#### Project Details

This was the first approach to unreal engine, I created the car movement from scratch also implementing a dynamic sound effect for the engine of the car, making it sound  more realistic. The game has breakable objects so you can destroy the objects and turn them into pieces. <br>

The game also has 4 different platforms with interactions, so you have to use them smartly in order to win the game.

#### Project Requirements

Make an arena with multiple turrets where you have to destroy them with a car. Use Unreal with c++.
