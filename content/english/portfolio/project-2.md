#### Project Details
In tower defense polygons the objective is to defend your base, the enemies are going spawn in the opposite side of your base and are going to find a path so they can reach your base.<br>

Your goal is to place turrets in a way that they can stop the enemies. Depending on how you place your turrets it will change the path of the enemies so you have to be smart with the placement. For your convinience you can sell turrets to change a path and it can be done at anytime which provide interesting mechanichs.<br>

Combining turrets is a most in the game, every time that you combine turrets you create a stronger turret with different bullets and different behaviour. Every next wave is going to be stronger so you can not sleep on using your gold to protect your base.<br>

Enjoy protecting your base and playing with your enemies paths!



#### Project Requirements
The requirement for this project was to make a tower defense game in an api provided by Ubisoft in the popular Ubisoft NEXT challenge. The Api was made in c++ and only had simple managers like sound, controls, and texture (openGl).

The challenge was to complete a fully playable game in a weekend, only using their API, which means only using c++ and openGL.
