#### Project Details
For this project I had the freedom to decide if doing q-bert in 2d like an exact copy or going for something different and try to do it 3D. I decided to do it 3D so could learn a little more about blender and how it works with Unity. I tried to be very careful  with the interface and the whole experience of the game, keeping most of the sounds and the timing in mechanic in the game. <br>

The leadeboard is one that you could find in the arcade version of Qbert, bouncing on the letters and showing a leaderboard with a no convencial format.


#### Project Requirements
Make a remake of the first level of Q-bert in unity, including the intro and the leaderboard. It also have to contain all the mechanics and interactions that the old Q-bert had, like killing coily with the elevator and what happens after that.<br>

For this project the deadline was 3 months but I finished in a week, trying to prove my commitment with course.
